# ✍️ Emotional Grammar Corrector 🧠💬

A unique AI-based tool that doesn't just correct your grammar—it **understands your emotional tone** and provides suggestions accordingly. Developed using Python, this project integrates emotion detection with grammar correction to make writing feedback more human and sensitive.

## 🧠 Core Idea
- Detect the **emotion** of the user (e.g., anger, sadness, joy)
- Apply **grammar correction** on their text
- Deliver corrections with tone-aware suggestions (e.g., calming suggestions for angry tone)

## 💡 Features
- Emotion detection from text or via DeepFace (if image used)
- Grammar correction using NLP tools
- Dynamic message generation based on detected emotion
- Suggestive rather than judgmental feedback style

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python
- DeepFace (for emotion detection)
- GingerIt / LanguageTool / TextBlob (for grammar checking)
- Colab or VS Code

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Run the script (in Colab or Python IDE)
2. Paste or type a sentence with errors
3. The system detects emotion and shows:
   - Corrected sentence
   - Tone-aware feedback
4. Modify the emotion logic or grammar engine as needed

## 📌 Sample Output
📝 Original: bravo you did really great
✅ Corrected: Bravo, you did really great!
💬 Detected Emotion: annoyance (79.7%)
💡 Suggestion: Would you like to express this more calmly?


> 💡 Built as an innovative tool to blend grammar checking with emotional intelligence for better communication.
